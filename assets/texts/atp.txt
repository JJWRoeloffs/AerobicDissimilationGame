ATP
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) contains the sugar ribose, with the nitrogenous base adenine and a chain of three phosphate groups (the triphosphate group) bonded to it. It is a molecule that releases free energy when its phosphate bonds are hydrolyzed and ADP is formed. This energy is used to drive reactions that cannot happen spontaneously in cells.
