Citric acid cycle
The citric acid cycle is a chemical cycle involving eight steps that completes the metabolic breakdown of glucose molecules by oxidizing acetyl CoA (derived from pyruvate) to carbon dioxide. It occurs within the mitochondrion in eukaryotic cells and in in the cytosol of prokaryotes. It is the second major stage in cellular respiration, together with pyruvate oxidation.
