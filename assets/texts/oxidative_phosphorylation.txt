Oxidative phosphorylation
Oxidative phosphorylation is the production of ATP using energy derived from the redox reactions of an electron transport chain. It is the third major stage of cellular respiration. 
During oxidative phosphorylation, the electron transport chain accepts electrons from NADH generated during glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. These electrons are passed down the chain. A the end of the chain, the electrons are combined wiht oxygen (O2) and hydrogen ions (H+), forming water. The energy released at the each step of the chain is stored in a form the mitochondrion can use to make ATP from ADP.
