Aerobic Dissimilation
Aerobic dissimilation is a catabolic pathway for organic molecules. A catabolic pathway releases energy by breaking down complex molecules to simpler molecules. Aerobic dissimilation uses oxygen as the final electron acceptor in an electron transport chain and ultimately produces ATP. It is the most efficient catabolic pathway and is carried out in most eukaryotic cells and many prokaryotic organisms.
